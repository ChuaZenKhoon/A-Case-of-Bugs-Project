Thanks for trying my asset pack!
This is pack 1 of 2.
the 2nd pack will be uploaded when complete.(Not yet ready at time of writing this)

these pieces have all been tested to fit properly, although some of the texture seams are not perfect they work pretty well.(Substance painter does not like modular assets!)
for proper fitting, set unity snap settings to 3 in all axes, or a number evenly divisible by 3 then remember to hold Ctrl and drag pieces into place.

please leave any questions or comments on the forum for this asset! thanks :)
